This is the project for Meng Project

How to use this web application 
Currently I do not have a real sever for this project so if you want to use it, you may want to install the virtual environment to run the application.
 
To get started, 
1. Install virtual environment for this web application.
a. Install Python
b. Install Flask
For more details, see the section "Installing Flask" in the following page:
http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world

2. Clone or download this project

3. Run demo.py in the “app folder” to start the server.

4. Open a web browser and type http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in the URL, then you can see and use the software.
